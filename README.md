# Hand Gesture Interaction Tool

This simple example allows you to explore and experience a different way of interacting with interfaces. Unlike conventional user interfaces that often follow the same efficient and user-friendly approaches, this tool lets you use your left hand as the primary interaction medium. It detects your left hand and draws a circle around your fingertips in real-time.

You can play around with the first version of the tool here: [Version 1 - Left Hand Interaction](https://welgeen.nl/fckthinterface/follow/lefthand.html). Enjoy experimenting with the interface and see how hand gestures can be used to interact with the canvas.

### Feature Wishlist
There are several features we’d like to add in future versions, including:

- **Camera toggle:** Ability to turn the camera on or off.
- **Save code:** A way to save and load your code.
- **Black & white mode:** Option to switch to a minimalist color scheme.
- **Error handling:** Better error handling for smoother user experience.
- **Mobile version:** Support for mobile devices and touch interaction.
- **Customizable MediaPipe landmarks:** Allow users to configure the landmarks sent to MediaPipe for even more flexibility.

These are just a few ideas, and there’s sure to be more that can be added. If you have any suggestions or want to contribute, feel free to try out version 1 and help with further development!
